HW5

I did the homework myself. I am responsible for every line of code.

<li>In this homework. I pratice unsupervised learning by clustering a time series population dataset. Each time series is treated as a vector to calculate the distance between each other. I was introduced the intracluster variance to evaluate how good the data is separated. I also try to compare the k-mean clustering method vs hierarchial Clustering method on the dataset, but got the same performance. I also learn to use the silhouette analysis instead of elbow analysis to figure out the best number of clusters</li>
