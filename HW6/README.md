HW6

I did the homework myself. I am responsible for every line of code.

<li> In this homework, we learn how to detect point of change in the timeseries. From what I understand, detect point of change in time series is trying to cluster who timeseries into different smaller time series with different characteristic such as mean or variance. We also practice with rupture package. In general, the POC detection consists of 3 parts: loss function, search method, and constraint. We study the different loss function such as "l1 distance", "l2 distance" and kernel-based loss fuction like "rbf". Moreover we also practice the binary search method which has computation complexity at O(NlogN) and optimal method like Pelt.<li>
