HW3

Hau Phan

 I did the homework myself. I am responsible for every line of code.

<li>In this homework, we pratice ARMA models. Given multiple stock timeseries dataset, we are supposed to build the best ARMA model to forecast them. Depends on whether the timeseries is stationary or not, we need to define the hyperparameter lags of AR/MA.  </li>
