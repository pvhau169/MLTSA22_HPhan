I worked on this homwork myself. In this homework, I learned using autoencoder to compress the noisy timeseries data and use them to classify the timeseries label. However, the result showed that the compress bottle neck features is not good for classification model. The reason may comes from bad interpolation results from HW8. However, from Hw7 and HW9 I still learned some method to extract features from timeseries.
