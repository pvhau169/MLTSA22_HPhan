 I did the homework myself. I am responsible for every line of code.

<li>In this homework, we pratice facebook prophet model to forecast timeseries. Given the Uber ride data sets, we are supposed to analyze the trend, event whithin the timeseries. Since then, we design which feature is important to correct our prediction. For examples, temperature perday, and whether that day is holiday or not are considered as important features. We evaluate our models by calcuting its rchi2. From the results, I can tell the temperature feature helps increasing model's performance a lot. The holiday feature somehow makes the model confused and predict a high uncertainty interval. The Markov Chain Morte Carlo samples hurts model's performance due to lack of data to from a stationary Markov chain  </li>
